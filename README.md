# MapGenerator
Old code to generate a map for a hypothetical tactics game. 

Code was last touched October 2011, and is poorly documented. It will output the map of as a BMP file. The idea was this code could generate random maps for a tactics game, and the maps could be distrubted as raw BMP files. The map is technically generated upside down, since I never coded in a way to put all the image data onto a stack first. 

Feel free to use any part you like, this is mostly just for self record though.
